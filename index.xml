      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a long time thinking that the things I had to do were things I was naturally good at. In school, I exceled in math courses so when I went to college I became a math major. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t passionate about math. When I was a sophomore in college, I took a software engineering course. It didn&amp;rsquo;t come naturally to me, but I liked it. I love being able to solve a logical problem and see the result.</description>
