      <description>This is the day I forgot my camera. So unfortunately all the pictures that I took during my air balloon ride were on my iPhone 7. Overall it was really amazing,still scary, but a great experience. I met a really nice Chinese couple who were honeymooning through Spain along with the staff from Ballooning Barcelona. Afterwards, I walked to Park Güell and through the northern part of Barcelona and finished at a really nice sushi resturant called Robata.</description>

      <description>My second day in Spain I mostly spent climbing Monserrat. I took the Aeri de Monserrat cable car early in the morning to the Montserrat Monastery. I spent about an hour to two hours climbing to Sant Jeroni with a girl I met from Quebec, Canada. I went back into Barcelona in the evening to eat and relax and on the way back to my hotel I ran into two little girls playing a game of pretending to sell toys on the street.</description>

      <description>My first day in Barcelona, Spain! I started the morning by going to the La Boqueria, a local market in the center of the city. I walked around and went to the Catalonoia Square where you could feed pigeons and then headed to a reservation I had at Niño Viejo. Afterwards I went to Plaça d&#39;Espanya and Museu Nacional d&#39;Art de Catalunya. On my way back to my hotel to get ready for a local meet up I was attending, I met José and his chickens.</description>
