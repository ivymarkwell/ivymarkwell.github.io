              <p>
                After attending the 2019 Lone Star Elixir conference in Austin,
                Texas and hearing the release of Phoenix LiveView announced, I
                decided I wanted to jump on the train of dabbling in LiveView.
                At the time, a lot of the examples being released were mini
                games which is what initially inspired me to recreate
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)"
                  >Minesweeper</a
                >! After reading this you should understand what LiveView is,
                know some of the advantages and disadvantages of server side
                rendered HTML, and have an insight into how I used LiveView to
                build a clone of Minesweeper.
              </p>

              <h3 id="what-is-liveview">What is LiveView?</h3>

              <p>
                LiveView is a
                <a href="https://hex.pm/packages/phoenix_live_view"
                  >hex library</a
                >
                for managing application state and delivering server rendered
                HTML. To understand the LiveView lifecycle, we’ll first take a
                look at the different
                <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/templates.html"
                  >templates</a
                >
                used by a LiveView application.
              </p>

              <p>
                There are
                <a
                  href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html#module-live-layouts"
                  >3 layouts</a
                >
                (templates that render other templates) that are now in a
                Phoenix application:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  the root layout, <code>root.html.eex</code> — this is the
                  layout shared between LiveView and regular templates; this is
                  rendered only on the initial request for the application and
                  then is used to render other templates
                </li>
                <li>
                  the app layout, <code>app.html.eex</code> — this is the
                  default template in Phoenix that lives outside of the LiveView
                  library (meaning that it’s irrelevant in a strictly LiveView
                  application)
                </li>
                <li>
                  the live layout, <code>live.html.leex</code> — this is the
                  LiveView template that has access to the state of the
                  application and is updated as apart of the LiveView request
                  life cycle
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                LiveView starts by rendering the root layout on the initial
                request, and then establishes a connection with the client
                through
                <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html"
                  >Phoenix Channels</a
                >. <code>phx-</code>
                <a
                  href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html#module-bindings"
                  >bindings</a
                >
                defined in the live template dictate when events are fired off
                by the client, and then associated event handlers in the
                LiveView file will make appropriate updates to the application
                state. Anytime the state of the application is updated, LiveView
                will retrigger the <code>render</code> function that contains
                your live layout, <code>index.html.leex</code> and rerender the
                page for the user. Meaning you got yourself stateful Elixir
                rendered HTML.
              </p>

              <p>
                Understanding LiveView for me really came down to these 3 files:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <code>router.ex</code> — where we assign our LiveView and
                  define the root layout for our application.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                <img
                  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9qd9hZihawqZYwLli5LaGw.png"
                  alt=""
                />
                <span class="figcaption_hack"><code>router.ex</code> file</span>
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <code>root.html.eex</code> — our root layout. This is the view
                  that will be rendered on the initial request of the
                  application, create the client connection to the server via
                  web sockets (this happens specifically in the
                  <code>app.js</code> script), and also where the embeded
                  LiveView layout will be rendered later using the
                  <code>&lt;%= @inner_content %&gt;</code> tag.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                <img
                  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qetD22xhWGdQDQ44LkrrAA.png"
                  alt=""
                />
                <span class="figcaption_hack"
                  ><code>root.html.eex</code> file</span
                >
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <code>*_live.ex</code> — the “LiveView”. This is where the
                  state of the application is iterated on and where the LiveView
                  layout, <code>.leex</code> template extension, gets rendered
                  using the <code>render/1</code> function.
                  <code>render/1</code> can return inline HTML or an
                  <code>index.html.leex</code> file.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3 id="recreating-minesweeper-and-implementing-event-handlers">
                Recreating Minesweeper and implementing event handlers
              </h3>

              <p>
                (You can checkout and play my Minesweeper game
                <a href="https://github.com/ivymarkwell/minesweeper">here</a>!)
              </p>

              <p>
                The hardest part of writing my LiveView application had nothing
                to do with LiveView; it was figuring out the Minesweeper logic
                itself (let me know if you find any bugs!). All of the logic in
                some way involved implementing the event handlers to track the
                current state of the game and display it to the user.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the <code>*_live.ex</code> file diagram above, I briefly
                mentioned that the <code>mount/3</code> function will initialize
                the state of the application. The state in a LiveView is
                <a
                  href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html#module-assigns-and-liveeex-templates"
                  >stored in the socket as assigns.</a
                >
                Meaning that we can access a particular state key by using
                <code>socket.assigns.state_key</code> (in the LiveView itself)
                or by accessing it in the LiveView template with the notation
                <code>@state_key</code>.
              </p>

              <p>
                <img
                  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8mujz9tJaEc_gDYH1xlqlg.png"
                  alt=""
                />
                <span class="figcaption_hack">Minesweeper!</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                Let’s go through an example! A really simple feature is that
                clicking the face on the board will start a new game. In order
                to do this we need to add an event binding in our Live layout,
                <code>index.html.leex</code>, that will listen to click events,
                and also create the event handler in the LiveView,
                <code>minesweeper_live.ex</code> file itself that will update
                the state of our application to start the new game.
              </p>

              <pre><code>// index.html.leex, live layout file
&lt;span phx-click=&quot;restart-game&quot; class=&quot;status &lt;%= @game_status %&gt;&quot;/&gt;

// minesweeper_live.ex, the LiveView file
def handle_event(&quot;restart-game&quot;, _key, socket) do
   # randomly generate initial mines with random coordinates
   random_initial_x = Enum.random(1..@rows)
   random_initial_y = Enum.random(1..@columns)

              <p>
                To keep things simple, we can determine whether we’ve started a
                new game by looking only at the <code>@game_status</code> socket
                value. <code>@game_status</code> is one of the many state keys
                that I implemented in my <code>mount/3</code> function that were
                initialized when the page was rendered. If the
                <code>@game_status</code> value is “dead”, meaning the user has
                lost the game, then we will see the frowny face. When the user
                starts a new game, the value should get updated to “alive” and
                the face should return to a happy face.
              </p>

              <p>
                Using
                <a
                  href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html#module-bindings"
                  >bindings</a
                >
                we can do this really easily. LiveView uses the
                <code>phx-click</code> binding to listen to click events and
                send them to the server. In my LiveView layout, I define the
                <code>phx-click=&quot;restart-game&quot;</code> binding on the
                <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> wrapping the face, so that when the
                user clicks the face an event is fired. Then, in my LiveView
                file there is an equivalent event handler,
                <code>handle_event(&quot;restart-game&quot;)</code> that will
                receive the event and start a new game!
              </p>

              <p>
                Whenever we’re initializing or updating the state of our
                application we always return the socket with our new state
                attributes using the <code>assign/2</code> and
                <code>assign/3</code> function helpers. The assign function
                helpers take in the existing socket and a list of key/value
                state attributes and return the updated socket. So in the above
                code snippet, <code>new_game/3</code> is actually just a
                function that returns the output of the
                <code>assign/3</code> function with the new state attributes
                like this:
              </p>

              <pre><code>defp new_game(socket, _, _) do
   assign(socket,
      game_status: &quot;alive&quot;,
      ...
   )
end
</code></pre>

              <p>
                And just like that, we’ve created a click event handler that
                will start a new game!
              </p>

              <h3 id="advantages-and-disadvantages">
                Advantages and Disadvantages
              </h3>

              <p>
                Let’s start off by saying LiveView is super fast. Not only
                because of the persistent client connection but LiveView also
                uses DOM-diffing. When the state is updated and the page is
                rerendered, LiveView uses DOM-diffing to update the page. This
                prevents the entire page from being rerendered and instead only
                the parts of the DOM that have been updated.
              </p>

              <p>
                LiveView is also nice when you don’t want to have to manage both
                the client and the server. By no means is LiveView a replacement
                for Javascript frameworks that offer more complex interfaces,
                however there are instances where you want to enable real-time
                user interaction without the large overhead of a framework. This
                gives Elixir developers the option to create interactive
                applications without having to write or manage any Javascript.
              </p>

              <p>
                Ironically, LiveView’s best use cases are usually
                <em>not</em> games. In fact, LiveView is a little unnecessary in
                these cases because we’re making server requests when we might
                not need to. In my Minesweeper example, I could have written
                this just as a simple Javascript application with no concept of
                a backend. LiveView would have been more useful in this instance
                if I had created score keeping. This would have allowed me to
                update scores in real time for users. As Chris McCord said,
                LiveView’s best uses cases can be seen in
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  simple real-time updates, client-side style validations with
                  immediate feedback, [and] autocomplete inputs
                </p>
              </blockquote>

              <p>
                Lastly, LiveView has no offline capacity and could be a lot of
                demand on your host provider. Remember, every instance of your
                application will be creating a unique connection from the client
                which after many connections can either cause your application
                to lag or end up just costing you money from your provider.
              </p>

                There are a lot of helpful
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/ivymarkwell/phoenix-liveview-counter-tutorial"
                  >step by step tutorials</a
                >
                on how to get your first LiveView application up and running.
                Most of the work will be making your own unique application by
                updating the LiveView template to create the view you want and
                implementing the event handlers that will update your state.
              </p>

              <p>
                LiveView is still under active development and so unfortunately
                some guides are already becoming outdated. The best way to keep
                up to date is to follow the
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md"
                  >changelogs</a
                >. There’s already hype (mostly me) around the new command,
                <code>mix phx.new --live</code>, which will allow users to
                quickly initialize a LiveView application. Hopefully as more
                updates come out this makes starting your own LiveView project
                even easier.
              </p>
