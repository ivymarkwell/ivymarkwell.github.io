<p>After attending the 2019 Lone Star Elixir conference in Austin, Texas and
hearing the release of Phoenix LiveView announced, I decided I wanted to jump on
the train of dabbling in LiveView. At the time, a lot of the examples being
released were mini games which is what initially inspired me to recreate
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)">Minesweeper</a>! After
reading this you should understand what LiveView is, know some of the advantages
and disadvantages of server side rendered HTML, and have an insight into how I
used LiveView to build a clone of Minesweeper.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-liveview">What is LiveView?</h3>
<p>LiveView is a <a href="https://hex.pm/packages/phoenix_live_view">hex library</a> for
managing application state and delivering server rendered HTML. To understand
the LiveView lifecycle, we’ll first take a look at the different
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/templates.html">templates</a> used by a LiveView
application.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html#module-live-layouts">3
layouts</a>
(templates that render other templates) that are now in a Phoenix application:</p>
<ul>
<li>the root layout, <code>root.html.eex</code> — this is the layout shared between LiveView
and regular templates; this is rendered only on the initial request for the
application and then is used to render other templates</li>
<li>the app layout, <code>app.html.eex</code> — this is the default template in Phoenix that
lives outside of the LiveView library (meaning that it’s irrelevant in a
strictly LiveView application)</li>
<li>the live layout, <code>live.html.leex</code> — this is the LiveView template that has
access to the state of the application and is updated as apart of the LiveView
request life cycle</li>
</ul>
<p>LiveView starts by rendering the root layout on the initial request, and then
establishes a connection with the client through <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html">Phoenix
Channels</a>. <code>phx-</code>
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html#module-bindings">bindings</a>
defined in the live template dictate when events are fired off by the client,
and then associated event handlers in the LiveView file will make appropriate
updates to the application state. Anytime the state of the application is
updated, LiveView will retrigger the <code>render</code> function that contains your live
layout, <code>index.html.leex</code> and rerender the page for the user. Meaning you got
yourself stateful Elixir rendered HTML.</p>
<p>Understanding LiveView for me really came down to these 3 files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>router.ex</code> — where we assign our LiveView and define the root layout for our
application.</li>
</ul>
<figure style="text-align: center;">
    <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9qd9hZihawqZYwLli5LaGw.png' style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
    <figcaption style="margin-top: 0.5em;">`router.ex` file</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><code>root.html.eex</code> — our root layout. This is the view that will be rendered on the
initial request of the application, create the client connection to the server
via web sockets (this happens specifically in the <code>app.js</code> script), and also
where the embeded LiveView layout will be rendered later using the <code>&lt;%= @inner_content %&gt;</code> tag.</li>
</ul>
<figure style="text-align: center;">
    <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qetD22xhWGdQDQ44LkrrAA.png' style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
    <figcaption style="margin-top: 0.5em;">`root.html.eex` file</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><code>*_live.ex</code> — the “LiveView”. This is where the state of the application is
iterated on and where the LiveView layout, <code>.leex</code> template extension, gets
rendered using the <code>render/1</code> function. <code>render/1</code> can return inline HTML or an
<code>index.html.leex</code> file.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="recreating-minesweeper-and-implementing-event-handlers">Recreating Minesweeper and implementing event handlers</h3>
<p>(You can checkout and play my Minesweeper game
<a href="https://github.com/ivymarkwell/minesweeper">here</a>!)</p>
<p>The hardest part of writing my LiveView application had nothing to do with
LiveView; it was figuring out the Minesweeper logic itself (let me know if you
find any bugs!). All of the logic in some way involved implementing the event
handlers to track the current state of the game and display it to the user.</p>
<p>In the <code>*_live.ex</code> file diagram above, I briefly mentioned that the <code>mount/3</code>
function will initialize the state of the application. The state in a LiveView
is <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html#module-assigns-and-liveeex-templates">stored in the socket as
assigns.</a>
Meaning that we can access a particular state key by using
<code>socket.assigns.state_key</code> (in the LiveView itself) or by accessing it in the
LiveView template with the notation <code>@state_key</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s go through an example! A really simple feature is that clicking the face
on the board will start a new game. In order to do this we need to add an event
binding in our Live layout, <code>index.html.leex</code>, that will listen to click events,
and also create the event handler in the LiveView, <code>minesweeper_live.ex</code> file
itself that will update the state of our application to start the new game.</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">end</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>To keep things simple, we can determine whether we’ve started a new game by
looking only at the <code>@game_status</code> socket value. <code>@game_status</code> is one of the
many state keys that I implemented in my <code>mount/3</code> function that were
initialized when the page was rendered. If the <code>@game_status</code> value is “dead”,
meaning the user has lost the game, then we will see the frowny face. When the
user starts a new game, the value should get updated to “alive” and the face
should return to a happy face.</p>
<p>Using
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html#module-bindings">bindings</a>
we can do this really easily. LiveView uses the <code>phx-click</code> binding to listen to
click events and send them to the server. In my LiveView layout, I define the
<code>phx-click=&quot;restart-game&quot;</code> binding on the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> wrapping the face, so that
when the user clicks the face an event is fired. Then, in my LiveView file there
is an equivalent event handler, <code>handle_event(&quot;restart-game&quot;)</code> that will receive
the event and start a new game!</p>
<p>Whenever we’re initializing or updating the state of our application we always
return the socket with our new state attributes using the <code>assign/2</code> and
<code>assign/3</code> function helpers. The assign function helpers take in the existing
socket and a list of key/value state attributes and return the updated socket.
So in the above code snippet, <code>new_game/3</code> is actually just a function that
returns the output of the <code>assign/3</code> function with the new state attributes like
this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elixir" data-lang="elixir"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">defp</span> new_game(socket, _, _) <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>   assign(socket,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>      <span style="color:#e6db74">game_status</span>: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;alive&#34;</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>      ...
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>   )
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">end</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And just like that, we’ve created a click event handler that will start a new
game!</p>
<h3 id="advantages-and-disadvantages">Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
<p>Let’s start off by saying LiveView is super fast. Not only because of the
persistent client connection but LiveView also uses DOM-diffing. When the state
is updated and the page is rerendered, LiveView uses DOM-diffing to update the
page. This prevents the entire page from being rerendered and instead only the
parts of the DOM that have been updated.</p>
<p>LiveView is also nice when you don’t want to have to manage both the client and
the server. By no means is LiveView a replacement for Javascript frameworks that
offer more complex interfaces, however there are instances where you want to
enable real-time user interaction without the large overhead of a framework.
This gives Elixir developers the option to create interactive applications
without having to write or manage any Javascript.</p>
<p>Ironically, LiveView’s best use cases are usually <em>not</em> games. In fact, LiveView
is a little unnecessary in these cases because we’re making server requests when
we might not need to. In my Minesweeper example, I could have written this just
as a simple Javascript application with no concept of a backend. LiveView would
have been more useful in this instance if I had created score keeping. This
would have allowed me to update scores in real time for users. As Chris McCord
said, LiveView’s best uses cases can be seen in</p>
<blockquote>
<p>simple real-time updates, client-side style validations with immediate feedback,
[and] autocomplete inputs</p></blockquote>
<p>Lastly, LiveView has no offline capacity and could be a lot of demand on your
host provider. Remember, every instance of your application will be creating a
unique connection from the client which after many connections can either cause
your application to lag or end up just costing you money from your provider.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are a lot of helpful <a href="https://github.com/ivymarkwell/phoenix-liveview-counter-tutorial">step by step
tutorials</a> on
how to get your first LiveView application up and running. Most of the work will
be making your own unique application by updating the LiveView template to
create the view you want and implementing the event handlers that will update
your state.</p>
<p>LiveView is still under active development and so unfortunately some guides are
already becoming outdated. The best way to keep up to date is to follow the
<a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">changelogs</a>.
There’s already hype (mostly me) around the new command, <code>mix phx.new --live</code>,
which will allow users to quickly initialize a LiveView application. Hopefully
as more updates come out this makes starting your own LiveView project even
easier.</p>
<p>I hope you’re all staying safe during these hard times! Let me know if you have
any feedback in the comments below! I read a lot of other great articles that
helped solidify my understanding of LiveView and am really grateful Elixir has
such an amazing community to learn. As always, you can follow me on
<a href="https://medium.com/@ivymarkwell">Medium</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ivymarkwell">Github</a> to see what else I’m working on and
thanks for reading. 😊</p>
