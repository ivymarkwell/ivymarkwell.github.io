<p>This is a short walkthrough on how to use React-Router’s v5 <code>Prompt</code>component
to replace the built in user confirmation window object with your own custom
<code>UserConfirmation</code> modal.</p>

<p>There is another really <a href="https://medium.com/@michaelchan_13570/using-react-router-v4-prompt-with-custom-modal-component-ca839f5faf39">good
article</a>
about blocking the navigation to prevent the default modal so that we can render
our own custom component instead. They briefly mention an alternative method
that involves utilizing <code>BrowserRouter</code> and the <code>getUserConfirmation</code> prop,
which is exactly the solution this post covers!</p>

<h3 id="briefly-behind-the-scenes">Briefly Behind the Scenes</h3>

<p>Without going into too much detail, essentially you can trace the <code>Prompt</code>
component all the way through <code>RouterContext</code>, <code>Router</code> and <code>BrowserRouter</code>.</p>

<p><code>BrowserRouter</code> is where the magic begins. Specifically where the history prop
is created on <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/v5.0.0/packages/react-router-dom/modules/BrowserRouter.js">line
11</a>.
<code>react-router</code> uses <code>createBrowserHistory</code> to create our rendered history prop
as an extension of the <code>window.history</code> that’s available in any browser. If you
look in <code>createBrowserHistory</code>, you’ll also see the final layer of our
confirmation window which comes from the initialization of <code>getUserConfirmation</code>
from <code>getConfirmation</code> defined in <code>DomUtils</code>. This is where the default modal
gets defined as a window object.</p>

<pre><code>export function getConfirmation(message, callback) {
   callback(window.confirm(message));
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="creating-our-custom-userconfirmation-modal">Creating our Custom UserConfirmation modal</h3>

<p>Since we are opting out of the window object and replacing it with our own
custom component, we not only need to render a nicer modal but we also need to
include all of the functionality for canceling and confirming the callback.</p>

<p>Remember that <code>getUserConfirmation</code> is initialized in <code>BrowserRouter</code> and is
what determines what our confirmation modal displays. So wherever you’re
initializing your application with <code>BrowserRouter</code> is where we’re going to pass
our custom component into the <code>getUserConfirmation</code> prop.</p>

<p>And you’re ready to go! You’re now overwriting the default window component and
rendering your own custom <code>UserConfirmation</code> (even if it might not exist yet).</p>

<p>So let’s make it happen!</p>

<pre><code>import React from &quot;react&quot;;
import ReactDOM from &quot;react-dom&quot;;
import { Dialog } from &quot;evergreen-ui&quot;

const UserConfirmation = (message, callback) =&gt; {
   const container = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;);
   container.setAttribute(&quot;custom-confirmation-navigation&quot;, &quot;&quot;);
   document.body.appendChild(container);

   const closeModal = (callbackState) =&gt; {
      ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(container);
      callback(callbackState);
   };

   ReactDOM.render(
      &lt;Dialog
         cancelLabel=&quot;Cancel&quot;
         confirmLabel=&quot;Confirm&quot;
         isShown={true}
         onCacel={() =&gt; closeModal(false)}
         onConfirm={() =&gt; closeModal(true)}
         title=&quot;Warning&quot;
      &gt;
       {message}
      &lt;/Dialog&gt;,
   container
  );
};

export default UserConfirmation;
</code></pre>

<p>There are a few key things that we needed to happen in our custom component
besides the UI. Since <code>BrowserRouter</code> and our custom component is rendered a
layer above where our normal application is rendered, we start by initializing a
container that we use to directly render the modal. Then we actually define what
the container is rendering.</p>

<p>This is where we create the functionality of closing the modal through either a
cancel or confirm action. In our <code>closeModal</code> function we unmount our manually
rendered component and either push the user to the next location or stay at the
location whether the <code>Prompt</code> was triggered. Fortunately, the callback function
that is passed from <code>Prompt</code> makes sending the user to the next location or
staying on the page really simple for us. All we need to pass <code>callback</code> is a
boolean that tells us whether the user wants to proceed with going to their next
location or doesn’t. So, when the user clicks “Cancel” we can call
<code>callback(false)</code> and likewise when they click “OK” we call <code>callback(true)</code>.</p>

<p>And that’s it! You’re done.</p>

<h3 id="but-i-want-more-than-a-message-and-a-callback">But I want more than a message and a callback</h3>

<p>This is the part where most people would choose another solution because they
want additional customization of the modal that go outside the two props that
are given to us.</p>

<p>Sadly, that is a legitimate concern. We can attempt to alleviate this a little
by a manipulating our <code>message</code> prop. Our <code>Prompt</code> component will only accept a
string into <code>message</code>. So what we can do here is pass in a stringified JSON
object with key-value pairs of things we’d like to have additional control over
and then parse them out later.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Prompt
   when={when}
   message={
      JSON.stringify(
         `{
           &quot;confirmText&quot;: &quot;Continue&quot;,
           &quot;messageText&quot;: &quot;It looks like you might have some unsaved
                       changes! Are you sure you want to continue?&quot;,
           &quot;cancelText&quot;: &quot;Do not Continue&quot;
          }`
      )
   }
/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then in our <code>UserConfirmation</code> modal instead of using <code>message</code> directly to
display text we need to create a <code>textObj</code> that we use to reference our
customized text keys.</p>

<pre><code>const textObj = JSON.parse(message);

&lt;Dialog
   cancelLabel={textObj.cancelText}
   confirmLabel={textObj.confirmText}
   isShown={true}
   onCacel={() =&gt; closeModal(false)}
   onConfirm={() =&gt; closeModal(true)}
   title=&quot;Warning&quot;
&gt;
   {textObj.messageText}
&lt;/Dialog&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now we’re at least going beyond a one dimensional modal that only allows us to
customize the prompt message displayed to the user. Similarly, you could use the
message prop to conditionally determine what to render. If we hadn’t passed for
example a <code>cancelText</code>, then in our Evergreen <code>Dialog</code> we could choose to set
<code>hasCancel</code> to false so we’re only rendering a confirm button and not a close
icon.</p>

<span class="figcaption_hack">A local duck I photographed recently</span></p>

<p>This is a comprehensive guide for creating your first static site using Hugo and
hosting it on GitHub pages.</p>

<h3 id="creating-your-site"><strong>Creating your site</strong></h3>

<p>First, make sure you have <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/">Hugo</a>
installed on your machine.</p>

<p>Now you can run these commands to make your first site.</p>

<p>And there you go! You’ve created your first Hugo site. I mean, there’s nothing
in it, but still! Let’s take a look.</p>

<pre><code>hugo server -D
</code></pre>

<p>Your web server by default should be hosted at
<a href="http://localhost:1313/">http://localhost:1313/.</a></p>

<p>There should be nothing here. We have to add themes, content, and lots of other
fun stuff.</p>

<p>If you navigate to <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">Hugo,</a> you can see a complete
list of themes that you can use to style your site. In my own personal Hugo site
I, use <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/minimal/">Minimal</a>, so let’s start there. First
we need to initialize our Github repo, add the theme as a submodule in
<code>themes/minimal</code> and copy the default config file for that theme.</p>

<pre><code>git init
</code></pre>

<p>Now when you host your server, you should notice that you have the exact <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/minimal/">demo
page</a> shown on the theme’s page.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*fsJe92qbKtKv_BmrjvV_8Q.png" alt="" />
<span class="figcaption_hack">Hugo’s Demo Page</span></p>

<p>Once that is set up, you should be able to customize it! If you navigate back to
our Minimal theme’s documentation page you should find a small guide on using
the parameters to customize the aesthetics of your site.</p>

<p>Once you’re done making your site *beautiful, *you can navigate back to Hugo’s
<a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Getting Started page</a> and
generate actual content for your site. Generating content on your Hugo site is
super important because Hugo won’t generate your subpages unless there is
content to display (or if your content is in <code>draft: true</code>).</p>

<h3 id="deploying"><strong>Deploying</strong></h3>

<p>This is where things get tricky.</p>

<p>Github pages doesn’t natively support Hugo like it does Jekyll (another SSG) so
we’re going to have to create two Github repositories; one to hold your Hugo
site and files, and one to hold the HTML files we have to generate for your
actual Github page to read and render. Once you’ve created your remote repos on
Github <code>&lt;username&gt;.github.io</code> and <code>hugo_site</code> we need to connect them to the
site we just made.</p>

<p>First, let’s sync our repo and our code base and add
<code>&lt;github_username.github.io&gt;</code> as a submodule to our existing repo just like our
theme.</p>

<pre><code>git remote add origin
:&lt;github_username&gt;/hugo_site.git
git add .
git commit -m &quot;Initial commit for our Hugo site.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Remember, this only pushes to <code>hugo_site</code> . We still need to generate our html
pages for our <code>&lt;github_username&gt;</code> repo. Hugo already has a built in command,
<code>Hugo</code>, that generates your files to a <code>Public</code> folder. We need to change our
<code>config.toml</code> file to output our HTML files to our submodule
<code>&lt;github_username&gt;.github.io</code>.</p>

<p>Open your <code>config.toml</code>:</p>

<pre><code>baseURL = &quot;
&quot;
languageCode = &quot;en-us&quot;
title = &quot;Minimal&quot;
theme = &quot;minimal&quot;
disqusShortname = &quot;username&quot; # delete this to disable disqus comments
googleAnalytics = &quot;&quot;
publishDir = &quot;&lt;github_username&gt;.github.io&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The default <code>config.toml</code> for the Minimal theme should look a little like this.
However, here we added in <code>publishDir</code>. This tells Hugo where to create our HTML
files from the content in our Hugo site.</p>

<p>Let’s generate them by running the following command:</p>

<pre><code>hugo
</code></pre>

<p>And that should be it. Hugo already comes built with a simple command to
generate the HTML from any of the customizable content in your site. If you look
in your <code>&lt;github_username&gt;.github.io</code> folder now you should see HTML and CSS
files, stuff that Github pages understands!</p>

<p>Before we finally deploy, we need to make sure our remotes our set up correctly
one last time.</p>

<pre><code>cd &lt;github_username&gt;.github.io
git remote -v
&gt; origin
:&lt;github_username&gt;/&lt;github_username&gt;.github.io.git (fetch)
&gt; origin
:&lt;github_username&gt;/&lt;github_username&gt;.github.io.git (push)
</code></pre>

<p>Now let’s host it!</p>

<pre><code>git add .
git commit -m &quot;Oh my goodness, I'm hosting my first Hugo website!&quot;
git push origin master
</code></pre>

<p>Go to your Github page <code>&lt;github_username&gt;.github.io</code>. You should see your very
own custom Hugo site!</p>
